All mimsy were the borogoves,
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And burbled as it came!
And stood awhile in thought.
And the mome raths outgrabe.
And the mome raths outgrabe.
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
He chortled in his joy.
He left it dead, and with its head
He took his vorpal sword in hand;
He went galumphing back.
Long time the manxome foe he sought—
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
One, two! One, two! And through and through
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
The frumious Bandersnatch!”
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
